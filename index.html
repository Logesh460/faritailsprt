        <p>Every morning, as the sun peeks over the horizon, a giant rock formation catches the first rays of light. This is Pride Rock, home to Mufasa and his lovely wife, Queen Sarabi. On a particular morning, animals from all the Pride Lands had journeyed to Pride Rock to honor the birth of their newborn cub, Simba.As part of the celebration, Rafiki had a special duty. He cranked open a gourd, dipped his finger inside, and made a mark on Simba's forehead. Then he lifted the future King up high for all to see. The elephants trumpeted with their trunks, the monkeys jumped up and down, and the zebras stamped with their hooves with happiness.</p>

        <p>Not far from the ceremony, in a cave at the backside of Pride Rock, a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled. Life's not fair. I shall never be king. This was Mufasa's brother, Scar, who was jealous of Simba's position as the next King. Moments later, Mufasa was at the doorway to the cave. Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba. Zazu, Mufasa's trusted advisor, also appeared. You should have been first in line. I was first in line until the little hairball was born. And with that, Scar stalked out of the cave.Not far from the ceremony, in a cave at the backside of Pride Rock, a scraggly lion with a dark mane grumbled. Life's not fair. I shall never be king.

        <p>Later, as Simba headed back to down the path, he ran into Scar. Hey uncle Scar! Guess what? I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock. My dad just showed me the whole kingdom! And I'm gonna rule it all! Scar looked slyly the young cub. He didn't showed you what's beyond that rise at the northern border. Well no. He said I can't go there. And he's absolutely right. It's far to dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. Promise me you never visit that dread- full place.When Simba returned home, he found his friend Nala and her mother, Sarafina, visiting with Sarabi. Come on! I just heard about this great place! The mothers gave permission for the youngsters to go, as long as Zazu went with them. Simba and Nala raced across the Pride Lands in an effort to lose the watchful bird. They led him trough many herds of animals until they finally lost him. </p>

        <p>One the cubs were free of Zazu, Simba pounced on Nala, then Nala flipped Simba onto his back. They tumbled down a hill and landed in a dark ravine litter with elephant skulls and bones. Simba looked around and gasped. This is it! We made it! Before the cubs could explore any farther, Zazu tracked them down. We're way beyond the boundary of the Pride Lands. And right now we're all in very real danger.Suddenly three hyenas slithered out the eye sockets of an elephant skull. Frightened, Simba, Nala and Zazu jumped back. It was Banzai, his partner, Shenzi, and the always - laughing Ed. Banzai sneered. A trio of trespassers. Zazu tried to lead the cubs to safety, but Banzai grabbed him by the neck and plopped him down. The hyenas circled their prey, licking their chops. What's the hurry? We're love you to stick around for dinner.</p>

        <p>While the hyenas argued about who was going to eat whom, Simba, Nala and Zazu quickly slipped away. But the hyenas weren't distracted for long. They gave chase, and Simba and Nala had to run as fast as they could. Finally they tried hiding behind some elephant bones. Just when it looked as if it were all over for the cubs, Mufasa appeared and sent the hyenas flying with a swipe of his big paw. If you ever come to my son again... The hyenas slicked away, and Mufasa glared at Simba. You deliberately disobeyed me! I'm very disappointed in you !Mufasa sent Nala and Zazu home so he could talk privately to his son. Simba peered up at his father. I was just trying to be brave, like you. Being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble. Dad we're pals right? And we'll always be together right? Mufasa looked up at the stars. Simba, let me tell you something my father told me: Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be their to guide you. And so will I.

        <p>Simba, knowing the truth, leapt on Scar. Nala and the other lionesses joined the battle. Through the smoke and flames of the bushfire, Simba spotted Scar trying to escape and ran after the old lion. Scar pleaded with his nephew. Simba, I'll make it up to you. I promise. How can I prove myself to you? Run. Run away and never return. Scar started to slink off, but then he turned and lunged one last time at Simba. Simba moved quickly and flipped Scar over the edge, where a pack of hyenas were waiting hungrily.Limping badly, Simba climbed up to the very top of Pride Rock. He let out a magnificent roar as he looked over HIS kingdom. Before long, Pride Rock flourished again. Nala remained by Simba's side, and soon they had their own newborn cub.

After making a mark on the forehead of the young cub, Rafiki held him up for all the kingdom to see. </p>
